            <h4>Assumptions</h4>
            <p>
                This model assumes a death rate of 2.5169%. This is based off of
                data from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">CDC</a>
                that, as of March 13th, reported 1,629 cases and 41 deaths.
                Those of you visiting the CDC's site some time after March 13th
                will see different numbers. Is this the most accurrate death
                rate? Absolutely not. That comes in the months or years after
                a disease has run its course.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another assumption is a sick time of 3 weeks (21 days). This is
                based off of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-resource-center">Harvard Resource Center</a>,
                who states It depends on how sick you get. Those with mild cases
                appear to recover within one to two weeks. With severe cases,
                recovery can take six weeks or more." They are compiling
                information from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>,
                <a href="https://www.who.int/">WHO</a>, and
                <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">John Hopkins University COVID-19 Interactive Map</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Disease transmission here is done via checking proximity between
                squares, and then performing a probability check based off of the
                distance. Those probabilities for transmission go as follows:
                Directly adjacent (80%), two squares away (50%), three squares
                away (25%).
            </p>

            <p>
                In this model, we also allow for an individual to become infected
                and still have a chance to wash their hands (therby becoming
                healthy) once again. We're assumming an infected period of five
                days before this individual falls ill. Each day the individual
                is infected, there is a probability that the person can become
                healthy. This probability can be adjusted in the Handwashing
                Efficacy slider.

            <p>
                Hello, I'm Ron, CTO at <a href="https://www.outco.io/">Outco</a>.
                Outco is a Software Engineering Career Accelerator that guides
                software engineers of all seniority to earn great jobs. (<=almost
                verbatim from the landing page on our website) :)
            </p>

            <p>
                During a Tech Level Up session on March 13th, I began to build
                this model in light of recent events. Much news has come out
                about this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+curve">COVID-19 Curve</a>
                and I wanted to explore the possibility of modeling what ifs.
            </p>

            <p>
                What if we were to travel and go about our daily lives at our
                current pace?
            </p>

            <p>
                What if we began to isolate and reduced our interaction by 50%?
                75%?
            </p>

            <p>
                Please have fun with this model. We could all use some of that.
                These are extraordinary times. Call or web conference your
                friends/families. Also, keep yourselves informed.
